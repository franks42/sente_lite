## üî¥ CRITICAL: Keep This Document Current

**This is a LIVING document that MUST be updated as we learn.**

**UPDATE THIS DOCUMENT whenever you discover:**
- ‚úÖ A better way to perform any step
- ‚úÖ An edge case or failure mode not covered
- ‚úÖ Better verification commands or methods
- ‚úÖ Additional troubleshooting steps that work
- ‚úÖ Any improvement or clarification to the process

**Why this matters:**
- Stale documentation is worse than no documentation
- Future sessions depend on this being accurate
- Incorrect steps waste time and cause frustration
- This protocol is critical for development workflow

**When updating:**
1. Update the relevant section with new information
2. Update the "Version" and "Date" at the top
3. Commit with clear description of what changed
4. Tag if it's a significant protocol improvement

## FUNDAMENTAL RULE: NO CHEATING, NO LYING

**IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK ‚Üí STOP AND SAY IT DOESN'T WORK**

- If a port is still in use ‚Üí SAY IT'S STILL IN USE
- If a process won't die ‚Üí SAY IT WON'T DIE
- If a connection fails ‚Üí SAY IT FAILED
- If you see an error ‚Üí REPORT THE FULL ERROR
- If you're not sure ‚Üí SAY YOU'RE NOT SURE

**DO NOT:**
- Pretend things work when they don't
- Skip verification steps
- Assume success without checking
- Move forward when something fails
- Use optimistic language without proof

---

## The 5-Step Kill/Restart Sequence

### STEP 1: KILL EVERYTHING

**What to do:**
```bash
pkill -9 bb
pkill -9 node
```

**What this does:**
- Kills ALL Babashka processes (including the 4-service BB server)
- Kills ALL Node.js processes (including Playwright browsers)
- Uses -9 (SIGKILL) for forceful termination

**Verification:**
```bash
ps aux | grep -E "bb|node" | grep -v grep
```

**SUCCESS = Empty output (no bb or node processes)**

**FAILURE = Any line showing bb or node process**
- If you see processes still running ‚Üí REPORT IT
- If processes won't die ‚Üí REPORT IT
- DO NOT proceed to Step 2

---

### STEP 2: VERIFY PORTS ARE FREE

**What to do:**
```bash
lsof -i :1338 :1339 :1340 :1341 :1342
```

**What this checks:**
- Port 1338: BB nREPL (direct Clojure eval)
- Port 1339: Browser gateway (ClojureScript eval)
- Port 1340: WebSocket (browser nREPL connection)
- Port 1341: HTTP server (static files)
- Port 1342: Additional WebSocket (sente-lite testing)

**SUCCESS = Empty output (no output at all) OR error message "lsof: no port specification"**

**FAILURE = ANY line showing a process using these ports**

Example of FAILURE:
```
COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
java    12345  user   42u  IPv6 0x1234      0t0  TCP *:1338 (LISTEN)
```

**If ports are in use:**
1. REPORT which ports are still in use
2. REPORT which processes are holding them
3. Try to identify if they're old BB/node processes
4. Try `pkill -9` again
5. DO NOT proceed to Step 3 until ports are free

**Why this matters:**
- Old processes keep ports allocated
- New BB server can't bind to occupied ports
- Silent failures occur when ports are taken
- Browser connects to OLD dead instance

---

### STEP 3: START BB SERVER FRESH

**What to do:**
```bash
cd /Users/franksiebenlist/Development/sente_lite/dev/scittle-demo
bb dev
```

**What this starts:**
The `bb dev` command (defined in `bb.edn`) starts 4 parallel services:

1. **Port 1338: BB nREPL server**
   - Direct nREPL into BB process
   - Eval Clojure code in BB server memory
   - Protocol: nREPL (bencode)

2. **Port 1339: Browser nREPL gateway**
   - Converts bencode ‚Üî EDN
   - Forwards to/from port 1340 WebSocket
   - Protocol: nREPL (bencode) ‚Üí EDN ‚Üí WebSocket

3. **Port 1340: WebSocket server**
   - Accepts browser WebSocket connections
   - Runs Scittle nREPL server in browser
   - Protocol: WebSocket (EDN messages)

4. **Port 1341: HTTP static file server**
   - Serves index.html and playground.cljs
   - Enables browser to load Scittle
   - Protocol: HTTP/1.1

**Expected output:**
```
[1/4] Starting nREPL server on port 1338...
nREPL server started on port 1338 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:1338
[2/4] Starting browser nREPL gateway on port 1339...
Browser nREPL gateway started on port 1339
[3/4] Starting WebSocket server on port 1340...
WebSocket server started on port 1340
[4/4] Starting HTTP server on port 1341...
HTTP server started on port 1341
All services running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# In a NEW terminal
lsof -i :1338 :1339 :1340 :1341
```

**SUCCESS = 4 lines showing bb process listening on all 4 ports**

Example:
```
COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
bb      12345  user   42u  IPv6 0x1234      0t0  TCP *:1338 (LISTEN)
bb      12345  user   43u  IPv6 0x1235      0t0  TCP *:1339 (LISTEN)
bb      12345  user   44u  IPv6 0x1236      0t0  TCP *:1340 (LISTEN)
bb      12345  user   45u  IPv6 0x1237      0t0  TCP *:1341 (LISTEN)
```

**FAILURE = Any of the following:**
- Fewer than 4 ports listening
- Error messages in BB output
- Process crashes or exits
- Ports show different PID (means old process still running)

**If Step 3 fails:**
1. REPORT the exact error message
2. REPORT which ports did/didn't start
3. GO BACK TO STEP 1 (kill everything again)
4. DO NOT proceed to Step 4

**Test BB nREPL (optional but recommended):**
```bash
bb -Sdeps '{:deps {babashka/nrepl-client {:git/url "https://github.com/babashka/nrepl-client" :git/sha "19fbef2525e47d80b9278c49a545de58f48ee7cf"}}}' -e '
(require (quote [babashka.nrepl-client :as nrepl]))
(nrepl/eval-expr {:port 1338 :expr "(+ 10 20 30)"})'
```

Expected: `{:vals [60]}`

---

### STEP 4: START PLAYWRIGHT BROWSER FRESH

**What to do:**
```bash
# In a NEW terminal (leave BB server running in first terminal)
cd /Users/franksiebenlist/Development/sente_lite/dev/scittle-demo
npm run interactive
```

**What this does:**
- Launches Chromium browser via Playwright
- Opens http://localhost:1341/ (loads index.html)
- Opens Chrome DevTools for inspection
- Browser connects WebSocket to port 1340
- Scittle nREPL server starts IN THE BROWSER

**Expected output:**
```
> scittle-demo@1.0.0 interactive
> node playwright-interactive.mjs

Launching browser with DevTools...
Browser launched. Press Ctrl+C when done.
```

**Browser should show:**
- Page title: "Scittle nREPL Demo"
- Console shows Scittle loading messages
- No red error messages in console

**Verification - Check browser console:**
```
Open DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Scittle loaded"
- ‚úÖ "WebSocket connected to ws://localhost:1340"
- ‚úÖ "nREPL server ready"
- ‚ùå NO red error messages
- ‚ùå NO "connection refused"
- ‚ùå NO "failed to load"

**SUCCESS = Browser opens, DevTools visible, no errors in console, WebSocket connected**

**FAILURE = Any of the following:**
- Browser doesn't open
- Page shows error
- Console shows red errors
- WebSocket fails to connect
- "Connection refused" messages

**If Step 4 fails:**
1. REPORT the exact error from browser console
2. Check if BB server is still running (Step 3)
3. Check if port 1340 is listening (`lsof -i :1340`)
4. If BB server died ‚Üí GO BACK TO STEP 1
5. DO NOT proceed to Step 5

**Test browser nREPL (optional but recommended):**
```bash
# In a THIRD terminal
bb -Sdeps '{:deps {babashka/nrepl-client {:git/url "https://github.com/babashka/nrepl-client" :git/sha "19fbef2525e47d80b9278c49a545de58f48ee7cf"}}}' -e '
(require (quote [babashka.nrepl-client :as nrepl]))
(nrepl/eval-expr {:port 1339 :expr "(+ 1 2 3)"})'
```

Expected: `{:vals ["6"]}` (note: string "6", not number)

---

### STEP 5: RE-UPLOAD ALL CODE

**What gets lost on restart:**
- ALL code uploaded to BB server memory (via port 1338)
- ALL code uploaded to browser memory (via port 1339)
- ALL WebSocket servers created via nREPL
- ALL connections and state

**What to upload:**

#### 5A. Upload sente-lite SERVER code to BB (port 1338)

**Method 1: Using load-sente-server.bb script**
```bash
cd /Users/franksiebenlist/Development/sente_lite/dev/scittle-demo
./load-sente-server.bb
```

Expected output: (depends on what's in the script)

**Method 2: Manual upload via nREPL**
```bash
# Load server namespace
bb -Sdeps '{...}' -e '
(require (quote [babashka.nrepl-client :as nrepl]))
(nrepl/eval-expr {:port 1338 :expr "(load-file \"../../src/sente_lite/server.cljc\")"})'
```

**Verification:**
- Check for any error messages
- Eval should return success or namespace loaded

#### 5B. Upload sente-lite CLIENT code to browser (port 1339)

```bash
# Load client namespace in browser
bb -Sdeps '{...}' -e '
(require (quote [babashka.nrepl-client :as nrepl]))
(nrepl/eval-expr {:port 1339 :expr "(load-file \"path-to-client-code\")"})'
```

#### 5C. Start additional services (e.g., WebSocket on port 1342)

```bash
# Start http-kit WebSocket server in BB
bb -Sdeps '{...}' -e '
(require (quote [babashka.nrepl-client :as nrepl]))
(nrepl/eval-expr {:port 1338 :expr "
(do
  (require (quote [org.httpkit.server :as http]))
  (def test-server (http/run-server
    (fn [req] {:status 200 :body \"OK\"})
    {:port 1342})))"})'
```

**Verification:**
```bash
lsof -i :1342
```

Should show bb process listening on port 1342.

**SUCCESS = All code uploaded without errors, all expected services running**

**FAILURE = Any error during upload, missing services**

**If Step 5 fails:**
1. REPORT the exact error message
2. REPORT which upload step failed
3. Check if BB server is still running
4. Check if browser is still connected
5. If infrastructure died ‚Üí GO BACK TO STEP 1
6. DO NOT claim success

---

## What Gets Lost on Restart

**EVERYTHING loaded via nREPL is GONE:**

1. **BB Server Memory (port 1338):**
   - All loaded namespaces
   - All defined functions
   - All state (atoms, refs)
   - All running servers created via code

2. **Browser Memory (port 1339):**
   - All loaded ClojureScript code
   - All defined functions
   - All browser state
   - All DOM modifications

3. **Connections:**
   - All WebSocket connections
   - All subscriptions
   - All message handlers

**ONLY PERSISTENT:**
- The base 4 services (1338, 1339, 1340, 1341)
- Files on disk
- Git repository

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå MISTAKE 1: Not killing old processes
**Problem:** Multiple BB instances fighting for ports
**Symptom:** "Address already in use" errors
**Fix:** GO BACK TO STEP 1, verify with `ps` and `lsof`

### ‚ùå MISTAKE 2: Browser connected to old BB instance
**Problem:** Browser WebSocket connected to dead server
**Symptom:** nREPL commands hang, no response
**Fix:** GO BACK TO STEP 1, restart browser in Step 4

### ‚ùå MISTAKE 3: Forgetting to check ports
**Problem:** Old process still has ports allocated
**Symptom:** New BB starts but services fail silently
**Fix:** ALWAYS run Step 2 verification

### ‚ùå MISTAKE 4: Not re-uploading code
**Problem:** Trying to use functions that don't exist
**Symptom:** "Unable to resolve symbol" errors
**Fix:** Complete ALL of Step 5

### ‚ùå MISTAKE 5: Pretending things work
**Problem:** Moving forward when something failed
**Symptom:** Cascading failures, wasted time, frustration
**Fix:** STOP AND REPORT THE PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY

## Verification Checklist

Before claiming "deployment successful", verify ALL of the following:

- [ ] Step 1: No bb or node processes running (`ps aux | grep`)
- [ ] Step 2: All 5 ports are free (`lsof -i :1338 ...`)
- [ ] Step 3: BB server running with all 4 services (`lsof` shows 4 ports)
- [ ] Step 3: BB nREPL responds to test eval
- [ ] Step 4: Browser opens with no console errors
- [ ] Step 4: WebSocket connected (check browser DevTools)
- [ ] Step 4: Browser nREPL responds to test eval
- [ ] Step 5A: Server code uploaded without errors
- [ ] Step 5B: Client code uploaded without errors
- [ ] Step 5C: Additional services started (if needed)
- [ ] Final: Port 1342 listening (if applicable)

**ONLY AFTER ALL CHECKBOXES = ‚úÖ CAN YOU SAY "DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL"**

---

## When Something Goes Wrong

### Rule: START FROM SCRATCH

If ANY step fails, if ANYTHING doesn't work, if you're UNSURE:

1. **STOP**
2. **REPORT WHAT FAILED** (exact error, which step)
3. **GO BACK TO STEP 1**
4. **RUN THE FULL SEQUENCE AGAIN**

DO NOT:
- Try to "fix" individual services
- Skip steps
- Assume "it's probably fine"
- Continue forward

### Rule: NO CHEATING, NO LYING

- If you didn't verify something ‚Üí SAY YOU DIDN'T VERIFY IT
- If something looks wrong ‚Üí SAY IT LOOKS WRONG
- If you're not sure ‚Üí ASK FOR HELP

---

## Success Criteria

**You can ONLY claim success when:**

1. All 5 steps completed without errors
2. All verifications passed
3. All services responding to test evals
4. No error messages anywhere
5. All checkboxes marked ‚úÖ

**Success = Working system that you have PROVEN works through testing**

**NOT success = "It should work", "It's probably fine", "I think it's running"**

## Remember

**IF IT DOESN'T WORK ‚Üí SAY IT DOESN'T WORK**

The goal is a WORKING system, not a CLAIMED working system.

Honesty and verification are more valuable than speed.
