;; EXPERIMENTAL - DOES NOT WORK: Extract CLJS-only code using clojure.tools.reader
;;
;; Status: ABANDONED - Expands macros, corrupts source code
;; Problem: tools.reader + pprint expands syntax-quoted macros into unreadable mess
;;
;; Example failure:
;; - Input: (defmacro signal! [opts] `(when ~should-signal? ...))
;; - Output: (clojure.core/sequence (clojure.core/seq (clojure.core/concat ...)))
;; - Result: 100+ lines of garbage instead of original macro
;;
;; Decision: This approach is NOT VIABLE for preserving source code
;; See: CONTEXT.md Session 7, doc/plan.md "Future Enhancements"
;;
;; Would need: rewrite-clj or similar AST-preserving tool
;;
;; This file kept for reference only - DO NOT USE
