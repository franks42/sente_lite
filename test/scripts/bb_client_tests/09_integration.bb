(tel/log! :info "=== Phase 6e: Connection Management Integration Test ===")

;;
;; Phase 6e: Integration test combining all Phase 6 features
;;
;; This test validates that all connection management features work together:
;; - Phase 6a: Server heartbeat
;; - Phase 6b: Client state tracking with auto-pong
;; - Phase 6c: Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
;; - Phase 6d: Subscription restoration
;;
;; Scenarios tested:
;; 1. Normal connection with heartbeat and subscriptions
;; 2. Connection loss with auto-reconnection
;; 3. Subscription restoration after reconnect
;; 4. Heartbeat continues after reconnection
;; 5. Multiple disconnect/reconnect cycles
;; 6. Multiple clients with independent state
;;
