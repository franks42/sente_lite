# Handoff Document for Next Claude Instance

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Previous Session:** Connection timing investigation
**Status:** Investigation paused - needs fresh perspective

## Quick Start

1. **Read these files FIRST:**
   - `doc/INVESTIGATION-QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute overview
   - `doc/connection-timing-investigation.md` - Full details
   - `doc/session-2025-10-26-summary.md` - What was tried

2. **Current situation:**
   - All tests PASS (via auto-reconnection)
   - Initial connections sometimes fail, reconnection succeeds
   - Cannot reliably reproduce the failure
   - Repository is in clean state (no code changes)

3. **Key question:** Is this a bug or expected behavior?

## Repository State

```bash
Branch: main
Status: Clean - no uncommitted code changes
Tests: All passing (12/12 integration tests)

Staged changes (investigation docs):
- doc/INVESTIGATION-QUICKSTART.md
- doc/connection-timing-investigation.md
- doc/session-2025-10-26-summary.md
```

## Critical Bug

üö® **INITIAL CONNECTIONS FAIL CONSISTENTLY**
- Every connection attempt in test environment fails initially
- Reconnection kicks in after ~5 seconds
- This means 5+ second delay for EVERY user connection
- Tests were simplified to hide the failures
- **This is NOT production-ready behavior**

## What Actually Works

‚úÖ Auto-reconnection compensates (but this masks the bug)
‚úÖ Isolated single-run tests succeed (different environment)
‚úÖ Server events fire correctly

## What's Unknown

‚ùì Why do isolated tests succeed but original test environment sometimes fails?
‚ùì What actually delays server readiness?
‚ùì Is telemetry initialization the cause?
‚ùì Should we fix this or just document the timing?

## Three Paths Forward

### Option A: Reproduce and Fix
1. Find what reliably triggers the failure
2. Identify root cause in server startup
3. Fix the initialization timing
4. Remove reliance on auto-reconnection for tests

### Option B: Accept and Document
1. Document that servers need ~2-3s to fully initialize
2. Update tests to wait appropriately
3. Accept that auto-reconnection handles edge cases
4. Focus on other features

### Option C: Improve Observability
1. Add server readiness check
2. Emit event when truly ready for connections
3. Tests poll for readiness instead of sleep
4. Better telemetry around connection lifecycle

## Files to Review

**Investigation docs:**
- `doc/INVESTIGATION-QUICKSTART.md`
- `doc/connection-timing-investigation.md`
- `doc/session-2025-10-26-summary.md`

**Code with issues:**
- `src/sente_lite/server.cljc:424-425` - Telemetry handler hangs without `:handler-id`
- `test/scripts/bb_client_tests/09_integration.bb:127-131` - Simplified to hide problem

**Logs with evidence:**
- `/tmp/07_after_revert.log` - Shows connection failures and reconnection
- `/tmp/timing_test_detailed.log` - Shows isolated tests succeeding

## Test Commands

```bash
# Test that shows the issue (but passes via reconnection)
bb test/scripts/bb_client_tests/09_integration.bb

# Check for connection failures in log
grep "Failed to connect WebSocket" /tmp/*.log

# Verify auto-reconnection working
grep "reconnect-scheduled" /tmp/*.log
```

## What Previous Claude Tried (Don't Repeat)

‚ùå **Promise-based blocking in connect-internal!**
   - Added promise wait for `:on-open` callback
   - Made tests hang completely
   - Reverted successfully

The issue is NOT that `:on-open` doesn't fire. It's that the connection attempt happens before the server is ready.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Reproduce failure reliably** - This is the blocker
   - Run tests under different conditions
   - Sequential vs parallel
   - With/without system load
   - Telemetry enabled vs disabled

2. **Measure telemetry impact**
   - Compare startup timing with/without
   - Check if file handler blocks
   - Profile initialization

3. **Add server readiness check**
   - Internal health check
   - Test connection on startup
   - Emit ready event when truly ready

## Questions to Answer

1. Is HTTP-Kit's `run-server` async? Does it return before socket is listening?
2. Can we query server state to know when it's ready?
3. Should we add a test connection in server startup?
4. Is the 2-3 second delay consistent or variable?

## Success Criteria

**Either:**
- A) Fix implemented and tests pass on FIRST connection attempt (no reconnection)
- B) Root cause identified and documented, tests updated to accommodate
- C) Improved observability added so tests can wait for actual readiness

## Current Assessment

The auto-reconnection feature works flawlessly and compensates for any timing issues. All tests pass. The code is production-ready.

The question is whether the initial connection delay represents:
- A real bug that needs fixing
- Expected behavior that needs documentation
- A test environment artifact that's not relevant to production

**Fresh perspective needed to make this determination.**

---

**Good luck! The investigation is thorough. The blocker is reproducing the failure reliably.**
