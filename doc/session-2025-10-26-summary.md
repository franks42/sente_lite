# Session Summary: 2025-10-26

## What Was Accomplished

### Investigation Completed
- Thoroughly investigated WebSocket connection timing issues
- Identified that initial connections fail but auto-reconnection succeeds
- Created comprehensive investigation documentation
- Tested multiple scenarios with 5s, 2s, 1s, 250ms delays
- All tests currently pass (via reconnection mechanism)

### Documentation Created
- **`doc/connection-timing-investigation.md`** - Full analysis with hypotheses and next steps
- **`doc/INVESTIGATION-QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick reference for next investigation
- **`doc/session-2025-10-26-summary.md`** - This file

### Issues Identified

1. **Connection Timing Mystery** - Isolated tests succeed with 250ms delays, but original test environment shows failures at 2-3 seconds
2. **Telemetry Handler Hang** - Server hangs if telemetry enabled without `:handler-id`
3. **Simplified Integration Test** - Test was modified to skip message flow validation (hiding the problem)

### Code Changes
**NONE** - All attempted fixes were reverted. Repository is in clean state.

## What We Learned

### Confirmed Facts (Tested)
- ✅ 5-second wait after server start: Connections succeed
- ✅ 2-second wait after server start: Connections succeed (in isolation)
- ✅ 1-second wait: Works
- ✅ 250ms wait: Works
- ✅ Auto-reconnection compensates for any timing issues
- ✅ Server events (`::server-started`) fire correctly

### Unresolved Mysteries
- ❓ Why do isolated tests work but original test environment fails?
- ❓ Why does same code behave differently in different test scenarios?
- ❓ What actually delays server readiness beyond `::server-started` event?
- ❓ Is telemetry initialization the cause?

## Repository State

```
Branch: main
Working Tree: Clean (only investigation docs staged)
Tests: All passing (12/12 integration, reconnection tests pass)
Staged: doc/connection-timing-investigation.md
        doc/INVESTIGATION-QUICKSTART.md
```

## Test Files Created (in /tmp/)

Investigation created these test files (can be deleted or used for reference):
- `/tmp/test_5sec_wait.bb`
- `/tmp/test_5sec_no_telemetry.bb`
- `/tmp/test_2sec_wait.bb`
- `/tmp/test_2sec_with_telemetry.bb`
- `/tmp/test_single_connection.bb`
- `/tmp/test_connect_fix.bb`
- Various log files showing test results

## What Didn't Work

### Attempted Fix: Promise-Based Connection Wait
**File:** `test/scripts/bb_client_tests/ws_client_managed.clj`
**Change:** Added `(promise)` in `connect-internal!` to wait for `:on-open` callback
**Result:** Made things WORSE - tests hung completely
**Status:** REVERTED via `git restore`

Why it failed: The issue isn't that `:on-open` doesn't fire - it's that the connection attempt happens before the server is ready to accept connections.

## Recommendations for Next Session

### High Priority
1. **Reproduce failure reliably** - Find what triggers the timing difference
2. **Measure telemetry impact** - Test with/without, measure delays
3. **Add server readiness check** - Don't rely on `Thread/sleep`

### Medium Priority
4. Fix telemetry handler to handle nil `:handler-id`
5. Un-simplify integration test (restore message flow validation)
6. Add monitoring of `::server-started` vs actual connection readiness

### Consider
- Is this a real production issue or just test artifact?
- Should we accept that auto-reconnection handles this gracefully?
- Document timing requirements instead of fixing?

## Key Insight

The auto-reconnection feature WORKS PERFECTLY and masks the underlying timing issue. Tests pass. Code works in practice. The question is whether the initial connection delay is:

A) A bug that needs fixing
B) Expected behavior that should be documented
C) Test environment artifact that's not relevant to production

## For Next Claude Instance

Start by reading:
1. `doc/INVESTIGATION-QUICKSTART.md` - Quick overview
2. `doc/connection-timing-investigation.md` - Full details
3. Review `/tmp/07_after_revert.log` - Shows failure pattern
4. Try to reproduce failure reliably - that's the blocker

The investigation is thorough but inconclusive. Fresh perspective needed.

**Status:** Investigation paused - needs fresh approach
**Outcome:** Tests pass, auto-reconnection works, root cause unknown
